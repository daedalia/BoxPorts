Linux x86 games packaged for the RG552 on JELOS mainline that leverage the Box86\64 system

## Games

- [ ] A Short Hike - Working, low fps 10-20.
- [ ] Blasphemous - Loads to title, no input currently
- [ ] Broforce - Works, little stutter on asset load, using dev build currently.
- [ ] Dandara - Needs Steam stub lib copying over game content
- [ ] Downwell - To be tested with WINE, windows binary
- [x] Don't Starve
- [ ] Fluffy Horde - Loads to colour cycling screen, requires investigation
- [ ] Hollow Knight - Can crash, 15fps
- [ ] Huntdown - Works well, needs save location and config sorting
- [ ] If on a Winters Night, Four Travellers - Progress bar completes, crashes. try different version
- [ ] Lilas Sky Ark - Very slow, 8fps, newer release could spped things up
- [ ] Limbo - Loads, crashes at random points
- [ ] Locomotive - Runs well, controls assessment
- [ ] Peridium - Runs, removal of a lib prevents the resolution selection displaying at start, remove last added. Different res can cause crash, 960x640 seems good.
- [ ] Pixel Junk Shooter - Vertigo, sprites spin all the time. Spped seems good
- [ ] Primal Light - Works, controls need to be adjusted, low fps, 20fps. Reducing the res to 1x, need to stretch to screen somehow
- [ ] Satryn - Works well, stutter on asset load
- [ ] Super Blood Hockey - XNA, try with that instead
- [ ] Super Meat Boy - Needs save location sorting
- [ ] Swarm Racer - Works, on ES too, sort save location
- [ ] Sword and Sworcery - Doesn't load, maybe humble version
- [ ] The Bug Butcher - No load, yet.
- [ ] The Diasporic Crypt - No such file or directory, looks for lib
- [ ] The Powder Toy - Needs testing
- [ ] Zombusters - Monogame
